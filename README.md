#  VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
To help Steve analyze the entire stock market over the last few years.
### Purpose
To determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. To refactor the code to work with thousands of stocks instead of just one.
## Analysis and Challenges
To make the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
From the print out of the years 2017 and 2018 the stocks performed better in 2017. The VBA refactored script ran much faster than the original. For 2017 the refactored ran .109 and the original was .707. For 2018 it was .105 for refactored and .687 for the original. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge was to create the 3 arrays that were not in the original vba script. Then to loop through all the rows in the spreadsheet to include all the tickers and total volumes for each ticker. So I had to create a ticker index to count each ticker. Also I needed to find a way to get the starting and ending prices on the current ticker.
## Results

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    Some advantages of refactoring is to make the code easier to understand by others using the code. Also to help find bugs and make the code run          faster. The main disadvantage would be tring to understand the previous code depending on how complex it is.
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
    In this instance it did make the code run faster.
